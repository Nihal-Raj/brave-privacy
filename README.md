# Brave Browser Privacy
Makes Brave Browser More Private & Secure!

Steps:
1. Click on the 'Hamburger menu'. ![Screenshot (13)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80682093/132233765-59e71737-4c82-432e-9b34-06259a763c23.png)
2. Go to 'Settings'.
3. Under 'Get started' < 'On startup', select `Open the New Tab page`.
4. Under 'Shields' < 'Trackers & ads blocking', select `Aggressive` and in 'Fingerprinting blocking', select `Aggressive` too.
5. Under 'Privacy and security' < 'WebRTC IP handling policy, select `Disable non-proxified UDP` (disables the possibility to leak your IP address even when you're using a VPN).
6. Under 'Privacy and security', disable `Automatically send daily usage ping to Brave` and `Help improve Brave's features and performance`.
7. Under 'Privacy and security' < 'Clear browsing data', select `On exit`, and select everything.
8. Under 'Privacy and security' < 'Cookies and other site data', turn `Clear cookies and site data when you close all windows` and `Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browsing traffic` on.
9. Under 'Privacy and security' < 'Security' < 'Use secure DNS', select `with` < `Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)`, this prevents your ISP from keeping an eye on you (it's the fastest DNS, you may select any other).
10. Under 'Search engine' select `DuckDuckGo` (or any other privacy-friendly search engine).
11. Under 'Additional settings' < 'Autofill' < 'Passwords', turn off `Offer to save passwords` and `Auto Sign-in` (use a password manager for this purpose).

These all will give you the most control for your privacy.

# Why Not Any Other Web Browser?

Great question! You may think for 'Hardened Firefox', but Firefox is really insecure.

Brave is the closest web browser to both privacy and security.
